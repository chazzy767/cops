	<p4>What is House Check for Cops?</p4>
	<p>The house check app (working title) is an app for homeowners 
	that gives them peace of mind when they are away on vacation. With this app, 
	homeowners can rest easy knowing that their house is safe and being looked after while they are away. With a few simple clicks, the user can sign up for a house check. Just enter your information and the days that you will be gone, and at some point in that duration, one of our registered house checkers will stop by to make sure your house has been left untouched since you've been gone.</p>
	<p5>How it Works</p5>
	<p>When you first make your account, you will be prompted to enter your personal 
	information and address. Once logged in, you can sign up for a house check. 
	This will take you to a form to fill out where you will fill in any information 
	about the house you want the house checker to know about. Enter the dates 
	you will be leaving and returning, and then you are free to go on vacation. 
	A house checker will check your house peiodicall while you are away to make sure 
	nothing has happened since you left.</p>
	<p>Once the house check has been submitted, an administrator will log in and see your house check submition among a list of others. The house checker will be able to click on an address where a house check form has been submitted, and a map API of the house will appear for them so they know where it is. The house checker will then proceed to the house and fill out his own form verifiying the information that the reseident origionally submitted. Once the house checker has verified that the house is ok and the check is completed, the checker will submit his form and will move on to the next house check. an update to the residents profile will appear showing the time and status of the house checks completion.</p>
	<p>In the event the house checker notices something has gone wrong, 
	they will try to contact the homeowner and verify that it is ok. If the house 
	checker cannot, they will contact the authorities and inform them that the house has been tampered with.</p>
